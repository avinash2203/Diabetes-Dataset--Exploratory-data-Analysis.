# Diabetes-Dataset--Exploratory-data-Analysis.
This module is to explore the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. The dataset has certain features and based on that there is an Outcome Feature which is the target variable. The Outcome=0 means non-diabetic and outcome=1 means diabetic.

The tools needed for this module are:

1. Anaconda distribution of Python 3. You can use the standard python distribution but I would suggest go with the Anaconda distribution as it come with tools necessary for data analysis.

2. Jupyter notebook.

3. numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and scipy.


The notebook is self explanatory and gives you the basicc of data analysis. The notebook shows how can you find correlation between features and the target variables. The plots are to visualize the aspects of the data and we see certain central tendencies and outliers too with the help of box plot.
